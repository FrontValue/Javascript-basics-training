<h1>JavaScript wishlist example</h1>

<p>
    In this example, we're going to write a small application that lets us add products to a wishlist. Please note that
    it's 100% client side, and we don't store any data (yet), so if you refresh your page: the wishlist will be emptied.
</p>

<p>
    This example has 3 products, each product has its Add to wishlist button. When we click on this button, the product
    will be added to the wishlist, which will then be refreshed and displayed.
</p>

<p>
    We will create the prototype object to create a class that will be responsible to manage the wishlist. The
    skeleton of this class is already created, you will need to write the methods which are not implemented yet.
</p>

<h2>Products</h2>

<form id="newProductForm">
    <label for="product">New Product:</label>
    <input type="text" id="product" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" id="submitBtn">
</form>

<ul id="productList">
</ul>

<h2>Wishlist</h2>
