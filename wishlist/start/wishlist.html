<h1>JavaScript wishlist example</h1>

<p>
    In this example, we're going to write a small application that lets us add products to a wishlist. Please note that
    it's 100% client side, and we don't store any data (yet), so if you refresh your page: the wishlist will be emptied.
</p>

<p>
    This example has 3 products, each product has its Add to wishlist button. When we click on this button, the product
    will be added to the wishlist, which will then be refreshed and displayed.
</p>

<p>
    We will create the prototype object to create a class that will be responsible to manage the wishlist. The
    skeleton of this class is already created, you will need to write the methods which are not implemented yet.
</p>

<h2>Products</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <span>Product 1</span>
        <button id="product-1" data-id="P1" data-name="Product 1" class="add-to-wishlist">Add to wishlist</button>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Product 2</span>
        <button id="product-2" data-id="P2" data-name="Product 2" class="add-to-wishlist">Add to wishlist</button>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Product 3</span>
        <button id="product-3" data-id="P3" data-name="Product 3" class="add-to-wishlist">Add to wishlist</button>
    </li>
</ul>
