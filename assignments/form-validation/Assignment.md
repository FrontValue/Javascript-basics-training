# Assignment

The application is doing nothing yet. Let's get started ðŸ’»!

Start with implementing the following:
> - Implement the form using HTML and CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.
> - Write JavaScript code that performs the following validations:
>   - Name field: Check if the name has a minimum length of 2 characters and contains only alphabetic characters.
>   - Email field: Validate if the email address is in a valid format (e.g., example@example.com).
>   - Password field: Ensure the password has a minimum length of 8 characters.
>   - Confirm Password field: Verify if the value matches the entered password.
> - Display appropriate error messages near each field if the input is invalid.
> - Style the error messages to make them clearly visible to the user.
> - Disable the submit button if any of the form fields are invalid or not filled in at all.
> - When the form is submitted and all fields are valid, display a success message indicating that the form was submitted successfully.

Once implemented above functionality let's start testing the application by:
- Filling in correct / incorrect values in the inputs and see if the validation works
- Check if the submit button is not enabled before all validations give green light
- Check it you can successfully submit the form if all fields are valid
