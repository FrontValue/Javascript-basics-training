- `Name` (input field): Accepts alphabetic characters only, with a minimum length of 2 characters.
- `Email` (input field): Accepts a valid email address format.
- `Password` (input field): Should have a minimum length of 8 characters.
- `Confirm Password` (input field): Should match the entered password.
