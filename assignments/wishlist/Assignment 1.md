# Assignment 1

The application is doing nothing yet. Let's get started ðŸ’»! 

Start with implementing the following functions:
> - `contains(itemId)`:
>   - It should check if an item with the specified itemId already exists in the wishlist. It should return true if the item exists and false otherwise.
> - `add(item)`:
>   - It should add the item to the wishlist only if it doesn't already exist. After adding the item, call the render() method to update the display.
> - `remove(itemId)`:
>   - It should remove the item with the specified itemId from the wishlist. After removing the item, call the render() method to update the display.

Once implemented above functionality let's start testing the application by:
- Adding products to the wishlist and verifying that they are displayed correctly;
- Ensuring that duplicate items cannot be added to the wishlist;
- Making sure the "Remove from wishlist" button removes the respective item from the wishlist and updates the display accordingly. (you should be able to also add it back to the wishlist of course)
