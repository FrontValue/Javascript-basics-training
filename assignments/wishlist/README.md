# Wishlist

Your task is to complete the implementation of a JavaScript wishlist application that allows users to add products
to their wishlist. The provided code contains the HTML / CSS structure and a partially implemented Wishlist,
which manages the wishlist functionality. Your job is to implement the missing methods in the Wishlist class and
make the application fully functional.

## Assignments

We've created a skeleton Javascript file containing the basic functionality for the Wishlist implementation.

First (all the way at the bottom) there is a function to add EventListeners to every item in the product list.
Once the button is clicked it will add (to be implemented) the item to the wishlist.

You will find 2 already filled in functions:

- `render()`:
    - It will clear the current list (you will not see this actually);
    - It will loop through the list of items using a forEach loop
    - It will create an `li` element containing a button with an addEventListener to remove the current element from the
      list
    - It will add the name of the item to the `li` element
    - Finally it will add the newly created `li` element to the wishlist
- `clear()`:
    - It will remove all `li` elements in the wishlist
